      <!-- Inline Block elements -->
      <article class="inline-blocks">
        <div class="box box-inline width1">
          These two divs are positioned next to one another using <mark>display: inline-block</mark>
        </div>
        <div class="box box-inline width1">
          Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset ensure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a button margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inine elements.

      <!-- float postioned elements -->
      <article class="floats">
        <div class="box box-floats width1">
          These two positioned using <mark>float: left</mark>.
        </div>
        <div class="box box-floats width1">
          you can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the same page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but..

      <!-- Inline Block elements -->
      <article class="inline-blocks">
        <div class="box box-inline width2">
          What if I want my sdie-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50% , right?
        </div>
        <div class="box box-inline width2">
          Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will addd up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.
